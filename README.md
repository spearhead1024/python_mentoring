# Introduction

This is the code repository for the Manning Publications book, _Tiny Python Projects_, by Ken Youens-Clark.

https://www.manning.com/books/tiny-python-projects

There is a directory for each chapter of the book which describes in detail the skills you need to solve the coding challenges.
Each directory contains a `test.py` program you can use with `pytest` to check that you have written the program correctly.
The testing step is integral to writing.
You should run the test suite after every change to your program to ensure you are making progress!

# Forking GitHub repo

First use the GitHub interface to "fork" this repository into your own account. Then do `git clone` of *your* repository to get a local copy. Inside that checkout, do:

````
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kyclark/playful_python.git 
````

This will allow you to `git pull upstream master` in order to get updates. When you create new files, `git add/commit/push` them to *your* repository. (Please do not create pull requests on *my* repository -- unless, of course, you have suggestions for improving my repo!).
