# Introduction

> "The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." - Dennis Ritchie

I believe you can learn serious things through silly games. I also think you will learn best by *doing*. This is a book of programming exercises. Each chapter includes a description of a program you should write with examples of how the program should work. Most importantly, each program includes tests so that you know if your program is working well enough. 

I won't necessarily show you beforehand how to write each program. I'll describe what the program should do and provide some discussion about how to write it. I'll also create an appendix with short examples of how to do things like how to use `argparse`, how to read/write from/to a file, how to process all the files in a directory, how to extract k-mers from a string, etc. I'll provide some building blocks, but I want you to figure out how to put the pieces together.

When you are done with this books you be able to:

* Write command-line Python programs
* Process a variety of command-line arguments, options, and flags
* Write and run tests for your programs and functions
* Manipulate of Python data structures including strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
* Use higher-order functions like `map` and `filter`
* Write and use regular expressions
* Read, parse, and write various text formats
* Use and control of randomness
* Create and use graphs, kmers, Markov chains, Hamming distance, the Soundex algorithm, and more

## Forking GitHub repo

First use the GitHub interface to "fork" this repository into your own account. Then do `git clone` of *your* repository to get a local copy. Inside that checkout, do:

````
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kyclark/playful_python.git 
````

This will allow you to `git pull upstream master` in order to get updates. When you create new files, `git add/commit/push` them to *your* repository. (Please do not create pull requests on *my* repository -- unless, of course, you have suggestions for improving my repo!).


## new.py

I provide some useful programs in the `bin` directory including one called `new.py` that will help you stub out new Python programs using the `argparse` module to parse the command line arguments and options for your programs. I recommend you start every new program with this program. For example, in the `article` directory the `README.md` wants you to create a program called `article.py`. You should do this:

````
$ cd article
$ new.py article
````

This will create a new file called `article.py` (that has been made executable with `chmod +x`, if your operating system supports that) that has example code for you to start writing your program. 

## $PATH

Your `$PATH` is a list of directories where your operating system will look for programs. To see what your `$PATH` looks like, do:

````
$ echo $PATH
````

Probably each directory is separated by a colon (`:`). *The order of the directories matters!* For instance, it's common to have more than one version of Python installed. When you type `python` on the command line, the directories in your `$PATH` are searched in order, and the first `python` found is the one that is used (and it's probably Python version 2!)

You could execute `new.py` by giving the full path to the program, e.g., `$HOME/work/playful_python/bin/new.py`, but that's really tedious. It's best to put `new.py` into one of the directories that is already in your `$PATH` like maybe `/usr/local/bin`. The problem is that you probably need administrator privileges to write to most of the directories that are in your `$PATH`. If you are working on your laptop, this is probably not a problem, but if you are on a shared system, you probably won't be able to copy the program into your `$PATH` directories. 

An alternative is to alter your `$PATH` to include the directory where `new.py` is located. E.g., if `new.py` is in `$HOME/work/playful_python/bin/`, then add this directory to your `$PATH` -- probably by editing  `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` located in your `$HOME` directory (if you use `bash`). See the documentation for your shell of choice to understand how to edit and persist your `$PATH`.

For what it's worth, I always create a `$HOME/.local` directory for local installations of software I need, so I add `$HOME/.local/bin` to my `$PATH`. Then I copy programs like `new.py` there and they are available to me anywhere on the system.

## Testing your programs

Once you have stubbed out your new program, open it in your favorite editor and change the example arguments in `get_args` to suit the needs of your app, then add your code to `main` to accomplish the task described in the README. To run the test suite using `make`, you can type `make test` in the same directory as the `test.py` and `article.py` program. If your system does not have `make` or you just don't want to use it, type `pytest -v test.py`. 

Your goal is to pass all the tests. The tests are written in an order designed to guide you in how break the problem down, e.g., often a test will ask you to alter one bit of text from the command line, and this it will ask you to read and alter the text from a file. I would suggest you solve the tests in order. The `make test` target in every Makefile executes `pytest -xv test.py` where the `-x` flag will have `pytest` halt testing after it finds one that fails. There's no point in running every test when one fails, so I think this is less frustrating that seeing perhaps hundreds of lines of failing tests shoot by.

A fair number of the program rely on a dictionary of English words. To be sure that you can reproduce my results, I include a copy of mine in `inputs/words.zip`.

## Why Not Notebooks?

Notebooks are great for interactive exploration of data, especially if you want to visualize thing, but the downsides:

* Stored as JSON not line-oriented text, so no good `diff` tools
* Not easily shared
* Too easy to run cells out of order
* Hard to test
* No way to pass in arguments

I believe you can better learn how to create testable, **reproducible** software by writing command-line programs that always run from beginning to end and have a test suite. It's difficult to achieve that with Notebooks, but I do encourage you to explore Notebooks on your own.

## Code examples, the REPL

I always love when a language has a good REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) tool. Python and Haskell both excel in this respect. For simplicity's sake, I show the standard REPL when you execute `python3` on the command-line, but you won't be able to copy and paste the same code examples there. For your own purposes, I suggest using the iPython REPL (`ipython`) instead.
