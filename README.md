# Playful Python

I believe you can learn serious things through silly games. 

I'd like to make this into a book or something, similar to the Python bioinformatic/data science (https://github.com/kyclark/practical_python_for_data_science) repo. I think you will learn best by *doing*, so I think I will write this as a loose collection of exercises that spell out the skills I aim to teach with each exercise. I will create descriptions for each exercise with examples of how the program should work along with a test suite. You will need to write the program that satisfies the test suite.

# new_py.py

I provide a program in the `bin` directory called `new_py.py` that will help you stub out new Python programs using the fabulous `argparse` module to parse the command line arguments and options for your programs. I highly recommend you start every new program with this. For example, if the `README` say "Write a Python program called `abc.py` that ...", then you should do this:

````
$ new_py.py -a abc
````

To create a new `abc.py` program that has example code for you to start writing your program.
