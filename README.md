# Playful Python

I believe you can learn serious things through silly games. 

I'd like to make this into a book or something, similar to the Python bioinformatic/data science (https://github.com/kyclark/practical_python_for_data_science) repo. I think you will learn best by *doing*, so I think I will write this as a loose collection of exercises that spell out the skills I aim to teach with each exercise. I will create descriptions for each exercise with examples of how the program should work along with a test suite. You will need to write the program that satisfies the test suite.
