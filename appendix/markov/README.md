# N-grams, K-mers, and Markov Chains

Read about Markov chains:

* Claude Shannon's 1948 MS thesis, "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain 
* Chapter 3 of _The Practice of Programming_ by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike where they discuss implementations in C, C++, Java, awk, and Perl
* "Computer Recreations", A. K. Dewdney, Scientific American, 1989 (https://archive.org/details/ComputerRecreationsMarkovChainer)

I'd like you to consider how a Markov chain creates a graph structure. Consult the three PDFs (generated by the `mk-graphs.sh` program) that visualize the graphs created by k-mer sizes of 1, 2, 3, and 4 when given this input:

````
$ cat words.txt
maamselle
mabi
mabolo
mac
macaasim
macabre
````

Notice that sometimes the branches terminate and sometimes you can find multiple paths through the graphs. As `k` grows, there are fewer options.
