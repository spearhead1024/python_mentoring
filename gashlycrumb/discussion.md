If you haven't yet explored dictionaries, this is a natural solution.

## Edward Gorey

If you are not familiar with the work of Edward Gorey, please stop and go read about him immediately, e.g. https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/01/19/edward-gorey-the-gashlycrumb-tinies/! 

## Alternate text

Write your own version of Gorey's text and pass in your version as the `--file`. I include my own `alternate.txt` which I used the simple and Soundex rhymers to help me find words.

## Interactive version

Write an interactive version that takes input directly from the user:

````
$ ./gashlycrumb_i.py
Please provide a letter [! to quit]: a
A is for Amy who fell down the stairs.
Please provide a letter [! to quit]: b
B is for Basil assaulted by bears.
Please provide a letter [! to quit]: !
Bye
