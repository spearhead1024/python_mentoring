It was a long time since Nick had looked into a stream and seen trout. They
were very satisfactory. As the shadowof the kingfisher moved up the stream, a
big trout shot upstream in a long angle, only his shadow markin' the angle,
then lost his shadow as he came through the surface of the water, caught the
sun, and then, as he went back into the stream under the surface, his shadow
seemed to float down the stream with the current, unresistin', to his post
under the bridge where he tightened facin' up into the current. Nickâ€™s heart
tightened as the trout moved. He felt all the old feelin'.
