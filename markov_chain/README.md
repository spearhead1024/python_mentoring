# Markov Chain

_The Practice of Programming_ by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike describes the Markov Chain algorithm and how it can be implemented in C, C++, Java, awk, and Perl. You should write a Python program called `markov.py` that takes one or more text files as positional arguments for training

````
$ ./markov.py
usage: markov.py [-h] [-l int] [-n int] [-s int] FILE [FILE ...]
$ ./markov.py -h
usage: markov.py [-h] [-l int] [-n int] [-s int] FILE [FILE ...]

Markov Chain

positional arguments:
  FILE                  Training file(s)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l int, --length int  Output length (characters) (default: 50)
  -n int, --num_words int
                        Number of words (default: 2)
  -s int, --seed int    Random seed (default: None)
$ ./markov.py -s 2 ../inputs/const.txt
