A large jug contains 2018 nickels and 2019 dimes.  Next to the jug is a large pile of dimes (treat it as an unlimited number of dimes).  The following procedure is to be performed repeatedly until a single coin remains in the jug.

Two coins are chosen at random from the jug:

1. If both coins are dimes, one is put back and the other is discarded.
2. If both coins are nickels, both are discarded and a dime from the pile is added to the jug.
3. If one coin is a dime and the other is a nickel, the nickel is put back and the dime is discarded.

Will the last coin remaining in the jug be a nickel or a dime?
