# Scrambler

Write a Python program called `scrambler.py` that will take a single position positional argument that is text or a text file and then convert each word into a scrambled version. The scrambling should only work on words greater than 3 characters in length and should only scramble the letters in the middle, leaving the first and last characters unchanged. The program should take a `-s|--seed` argumen to pass to `random.seed`.

We'll need to use the same algorithm for scrambling the words. I used the `random.shuffle` method to mix up the letters in the middle, being sure that the word that gets created is not the same as the word that you are given. If the word is 3 characters or shorter, just return the word unchanged.
