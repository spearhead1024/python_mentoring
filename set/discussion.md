There's very little to see in `get_args`, just defining the `-s|--seed` and `-d|--debug` options, the former of which gets passed to `random.seed`. As in many other programs, I set up `logging.basicConfig` to log to a `filename='.log'` (so it will normally be hidden from view) using `filemode='w'` (so it will overwrite each time it runs), and setting the `level` either to `logging.DEBUG` or `logging.CRITICAL` depending on the presence of the `--debug` flag.

As stated in the introduction, I chose to use a `class` to represent the idea of a "card" in my program. I'm not actually a huge fan of object-oriented programming (OOP). I wrote object-oriented software for many years, and I find it can be rather bloated and confusing after a time. I prefer function-oriented programming these days and tend to be more influenced in my style by languages like Haskell, Elm, and Rust. The `@dataclass` decorator for a `class` makes it very easy to write an object in Python as it creates
